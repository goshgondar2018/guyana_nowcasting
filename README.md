# Code for "A nowcasting framework for correcting for reporting delays in malaria surveillance" by Tigist F. Menkir, Horace Cox, Canelle Poirier, Melanie Saul, Sharon Jones-Weekes, Collette Clementson, Pablo M. de Salazar, Mauricio Santillana‡, and Caroline O. Buckee‡

# Preliminary scripts #
All scripts for a-spatial descriptive data analysis and generating input files for nowcasting models

# Nowcasting functions #
All scripts necessary to run nowcasting models (DIM, NM1, NM2, and ensemble) and visualize their outputs

# Descriptive figures #
All output figures for a-spatial descriptive analysis

# Nowcasting figures #
All output figures related to nowcasting results

# data #
All data for a-spatial descriptive analysis and nowcasting models

# Format of repo #
1. PreScripts - all preliminary data prep and analysis scripts
2. DescriptiveOutput - all figure PDFs for a-spatial descriptive analysis
3. Nowcasting - scripts consisting of functions to run and plot DIM, NM1, NM2, and ensemble model results + their implementation
4. NowcastingOutput - all figure PDFs for DIM, NM1, NM2, and ensemble model + histograms pertaining to confidence interval construction
5. data - original CSV of all delay data used in descriptive analysis and to generate the input CSVs for nowcasts; sub-folder "nowcasting_input" includes all input CSVs for each region's DIM and NMs
